Lets talk about the code:
First I have added all the necessary imports, then secure your api keys b adding your keys in env file. after that we have a function name shutdown_server which can clean shutdown of the gRPC server when the application exits, preventing resource leaks. then we have a function of embed_audio, This function takes the generated audio file path as input and returns a success message if the embedding is successful, or an error message if it fails. and Finally we have this main route processes incoming requests to generate podcasts based on various input types (like URLs or text). It validates the input, calls the appropriate podcast generation function, and returns a JSON response with either the audio file path or an error message.

Now lets go to the output process:
